🔧 Configuration

.env for environment variables

MongoDB required (local or Atlas)

JWT secret key for authentication


📈 Performance Metrics

✅ DB queries optimized with pagination

✅ Error handler ensures consistent responses

✅ Secure authentication with JWT tokens

🔍 Troubleshooting

Common Issues

Database connection error → Check MONGODB_URI in .env

JWT expired → Re-login to refresh token

Server not starting → Check if PORT is already in use

Monitoring

Use integrated error handler for logs

Add a health check route (/health) if required

🛡️ Security

All secrets stored in .env

Passwords encrypted before saving to DB

JWT for secure authentication

Role-based authorization for sensitive routes
